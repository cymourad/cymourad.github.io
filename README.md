## Hi, I am Chris :smile:

I will be using this domain (hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) to host and demo a few projects and tools that I build for my community and friends.
I am always open for feedback and I am always down to have another person help me build/maintain those projects. So, please, if you have any ideas, improvements, questions, questions, or if you just wanna say hi, reach out to me :wink:

### UW Med School GPA Calculator

I am a student at the [Univesty of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) :books:, and most of friends are too. Somehow, most of them want to become doctors :syringe:. As it tuens out, (almost) every medical school has their own GPA calculation. If you are a UW student, you can save yourself a headache and have [this fun tool](cymourad.github.io/uw-med-gpa-calc) calculate all your different GPA's for you.
